# PintOS
A school project where we implemented the functionality of blocking threads, instead of letting them spin in a busy-wait loop. We also implemented a simple scheduling algorithm based on a narrow bridge scenario, where we view the system bus as a half-duplex communcation medium only able to handle three senders/readers at a time.
